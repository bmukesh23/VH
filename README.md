Description:

This project creates an interactive game application designed to train food delivery employees of companies like Swiggy and Zomato. The game simulates real-life scenarios where players navigate urban streets to deliver food orders as quickly and efficiently as possible. By incorporating elements of competition and gamification, the application aims to enhance the skills and understanding of delivery personnel regarding optimal routes, traffic patterns, and time management.

The game provides an engaging experience that allows employees to practice and improve their delivery strategies. Participants can compete to deliver items faster, with a leaderboard system to encourage healthy competition and continuous improvement. This application serves as both a training tool and a motivational platform, enhancing the overall efficiency of the food delivery process.

Features:

Delivery Route Simulation: Players are tasked with delivering food through a simulated urban environment, facing various challenges such as traffic, roadblocks, and time constraints.

Leaderboard and Competition: A leaderboard tracks the performance of participants, rewarding the fastest and most efficient deliveries. This encourages employees to continually refine their strategies.

Traffic and Route Learning: The game provides dynamic traffic updates, helping employees understand and adapt to real-time route conditions.

Gamified Training: Through points, achievements, and levels, the game motivates players to improve their delivery skills while making the learning process enjoyable.
